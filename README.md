## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Flask backend handling query endpoints like `/ask`, `/stats`, `/clustered-logs`
- `graylog_loader.py`: Handles loading and filtering logs from CSV (or future Graylog integration)
- `log_processing.py`: Extracts and enriches metadata from raw logs (e.g., ONU IDs, PONs)
- `prompt_templates.py`: Templates used to control the LLM behavior (summary, detailed, etc.)
- `nlplog_utils.py`: Synthetic log generation and FAISS vector store setup (not used)
- `logs-24h.csv`: Main input file containing system logs for the past 24 hours

## Notes
- Time filtering is based on a fixed reference time: `2025-05-16 12:55:00` (Europe/Belgrade)
